# GIT Fiddle

## Overview

Hello, amazing developer! ðŸ¤– `GIT Fiddle` is a set of Bash functions designed to simplify and automate Git operations within a development workflow. These functions handle branch creation, versioning, merging, committing, and more, making it easier for you to manage your Git repository efficiently from the command line.

## Usage

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Detailed Functionality

#### Branch Creation and Versioning

The `create` command creates a new branch with an automatically determined version based on the latest commit message.

#### Merge Restrictions

The `merge` command only allows merging to the `main` and `devel` branches from the `master` or `hotfix` branches, protecting the integrity of these branches.

#### Automatic Commit Messages

The `commit` command automatically prefixes commit messages with the branch type, ensuring consistent and descriptive commit history.

#### Error Handling and Status Checks

Functions handle errors gracefully, providing feedback if an operation fails. The `commit` function also respects the `.gitignore` file when adding files.

### Security and Best Practices

**Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly.

**File Paths**: Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Error Handling**: Properly handle errors to avoid unexpected failures.
